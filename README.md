This Jupyter notebook serves as supplementary material to the Python code from the book [Numerical Methods for Scientific Computing](https://www.equalsharepress.com/media/NMFSC.pdf). This notebook was written and tested using Python version 3.9.7. By-and-large, the snippets are verbatim from the book with the an occasional explicit output, plot statement, or variable declaration. These code snippets are minimal working toy algorithms meant to better understand the mathematics that goes into them.
